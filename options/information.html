            <p>At Lablr, we're trying to bring reality to Social Media. We here at Lablr have seen and experienced the negatives of Body Dysmorphia and self conciousness that stem from social media and have come up with a solution to the problem. With our extension, you have the power to see when Users have edited their pictures to portray unrealistic body expectations to young children. We use a combination of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and a database sourced by the community and moderated by Lablr to show when Instagram Users have edited their pictures or are known to. We're here to provide a fresh perspective on Social Media and the unethical practices behind it.</p>
